*Spike Plan*
*Name: Firebird Spike*

*Context:*
Team needs to use a database to store data for application developed during this subject and must learn to use the Firebird DBMS tools to be able to script the creation and population of the database.

*Knowledge Gap:*
The team is not familiar with the Firebird DBMS that has been chosen by the subject conveners. Need to install and make use of the following tools for Firebird:
 # FSQL command line tool
 # FlameRobin GUI admin tool

*Goals/Deliver ables:*
 # Scripts need to create database that models the application domain
 # Scripts to insert initial test data into the database
 # Batch file, makefile or MSBuild script that includes database setup and tear down

*Planned start date:* 13/08/2007
*Deadline:* 20/08/2007

*Planning notes:*
 # Design database tables for the teamâ€™s application domain.
 # Install and configure fsql and flamerobin with embedded Firebird driver if required
 # Create scripts to construct the database tables
 # Create scripts to populate the database tables with initial test data
 # Create scripts to tear down database
 # Create batch/makefile/build script with two targets, one to construct and populate (setup) the database, and the other to tear down the database.
